Need to-do before FOSS launch:

* Create Django cheatsheet

* Create react cheat-sheet (includes Redux diagram)

* I THINK DONE: Need to redo as cleaner SVG `sql_joins_needs_replacement.png`
  (also, simplify probably and have consistent examples)

* Bash CLI and Git cheatsheet

Maybe:

* SQL cheat-sheet with example Joins

* Create OOP Python cheat-sheet

* Create HTTP / API cheatsheet
