# Kickstart Cheatsheets


A variety of Cheatsheets, optimized to look good when printed, but usable on a screen also.

These were originally designed for Kickstart Coding, the affordable, inclusive,
and intensive coding course teaching cutting-edge Python / Django and
JavaScript / React web development in Oakland, CA.

## Download

Click on one of the following to download. These are all 1 page long, and look
great when printed. Consider printing to hang up near your computer as you code
or learn a new programming language!


# Contributing

* These cheatsheets are written in Markdown, converted into LaTeX using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/),
  which then generates attractive PDFs from the LaTeX using the (very messy)
  template found in `templates/template.tex`. All this is tied together using
  the Bash script [build.sh](./build.sh)


* **Writing your own**: Want to write your own? It's easy, as long as you know
  Markdown! Look at the existing `.md` source files for ideas, then follow the
  [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on how to re-build the
  PDFs yourself.

* **License**: These cheatsheets and the scripts involved with their build
  process are (C) Kickstart Coding and released under the GPL 3.0
