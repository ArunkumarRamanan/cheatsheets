# Jinja templates {-}

variables
:   \ 

    ```html
    <p>My name is {{ name }}!</p>
    ```

if
:   \ 

    ```html
    {% if age > 17 %}
        <p>You may continue.</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Too young.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

for
:   \ 

    ```html
    {% for post in blog_posts %}
        <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    {% empty %}
        <p>No posts found!</p>
    {% endfor %}
    ```

filters
:   \ 

    ```html
    <p>Hi {{ name|upper }}</p>
    ```

include
:   \ 

    ```html
    <form>
    {% include "form.html" %}
    </form>
    ```

extends & blocks
:   \ 

    ```html
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block title %}
        This replaces base.html's
        title block
    {% endblock %}

    {% block main_content %}
        Body might go here
    {% endblock main_content %}
    ```

# Using Jinja {-}

```python
from jinja2 import Template

template = Template("""
    <h1>hi {{ name }}!</h1>
""")

result = template.render(
    name="Joaqu√≠n",
)
print(result)
```

# Pipenv {-}


Creating a new virtualenv
:   \ 

    ```bash
    pipenv --python 3.6
    ```

Enter current virtualenv
:   \ 

    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

Install a new package from PyPI
:   \ 

    ```bash
    pipenv install jinja2
    ```

Install all packages listed in Pipfile
:   \ 

    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

# Modules {-}

A module is a file or directory which provides functions, classes, or variables
that can be imported and used by other Python files. Syntax and dir structure:

```python
# - main.py
# - module_name/
#    - __init__.py
#    - submod_a.py
#    - submodule_b.py
import module_name
from module_name import (
    submod_a,
    submodule_b,
)
from module_name.submod_a import (
    function_name,
    variable_name,
    ClassName,
)
```

# Jinja key terms {-}

Context

:   A dictionary representing a collection of *context variables* to be
inserted or otherwise used in various places in a template


Template

:   A string or file, often consisting of HTML, containing "placeholder" spots
for variable data to be inserted, and sometimes simple logic


Render

:   When a template is combined with a context to produce finished results

# OOP Terminology {-}


OOP

:   Object Oriented Programming - a way of thinking and arranging data in
programming that groups types of data ("properties") with functions ("methods")
and calls the entire thing a "class"


Class

:   also known as an object's "type", classes form "blueprints" for creating
new object instances, defining methods and properties


Object instance

:   A specific occurrence of a class. Creating one is called *instantiation* or
*constructrion*.


Method

:   A function defined in a class declaration that gets attached ("bound") to
every class instance, and can be accessed with a `.` character


Property

:   Data stored by the class, can be accessed with a `.` character


Constructor

:   A special method that is run when you instantiate a class


Extend

:   Classes (the subclass) can *inherit* or *extend* another class (the base
class) which effectively copies over all the methods and property defaults


Overriding

:   When a subclass replaces a base class method we say it is overridden

Super

:   Super is a keyword to allow subclasses to access an overridden method on a
base class


Software architecture

:   High-level, executive summary of the design of a piece of software to
facilitate collaboration within a team

Interface

:   The outwardly facing methods and properties of a class


# Python Class Syntax {-}

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.logged_in = False

    def login(self):
        self.logged_in = True


class StudentUser(User):
    def login(self):
        super(self).login()
        self.attended = True
```
